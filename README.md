# C Practice

## Overview
These are my C practice programs.

## Usage
To run any of the practice programs, use the following command:

```bash
gcc src/<program_name>.c -o out/<program_name> && out/<program_name>
```

Replace `<program_name>` with the name of the binary you want to run (e.g., `hello-world`).
